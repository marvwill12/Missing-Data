### The first model is a linear regression which predicts income according to the respondent's group and whether or not the respondent graduated college. Our 2 predictor variables blues and college were both statistically significant predictors. With a coefficient of  10767, this tells us that for every unit increase, those with membership in the blue group is positively associated with a $10,767 increase in income. We also see a positive association with the college, with a coefficient of 8203.6. This tells us that those who attended college see an $8,203 increase in income for every unit increase. 

```{r, include = T}
model1<- glm(income ~ blues + college, data, family = "gaussian")
summary(model1)
```
### Specifying the variables types
```{r, include = T}
summary(data)
id.vars <- c("X")
nom.vars <- names(data)[c(2,3)]
hist(data$income)
```
### A histogram of the income variable shows an income distribution that is relatively similar to that of the actual income distribution. Logging wouldn't be necessary as this right-skew is expected. 

```{r}
data=apply_labels(data, 
                  college= "Respondent a college Graduate?",
                  blues= "Is in Blue group?",
                  income= "Annual Household Income")
str(data)
```

### Creating labels for College variable
```{r}
College = c(0,1)
var_lab(College)= "Is respondent a college Graduate?"
val_lab(College)= num_lab("
                          1 College Graduate
                          0 Not a College Graduate
                          ")
```

```{r}
set.seed(914)
data.imp <-amelia(data,
                 m=5,
                 idvars = id.vars,
                 noms = nom.vars,
                 empr = 0,
                 emburn = c(25,100)
                 )
```

#NA's are removed from college and blues variables after using summary to check.  

```{r}
summary(data.imp$imputations$imp1)
compare.density(data.imp, var="income")
#Continuous Variable
```
## Diagnosing Impuations
### There doesn't show any mean imputations, with no missing data.

```{r}
overimpute(data.imp, var = "income")
#Continuous Variable
```

### The over imputation diagnostic chart shows us that the confidence intervals for the observed data, for the most part, fall within the y = x line. Although more accurate for at the lower-middle of they = x line, as the values get higher, we see accuracy begins to decrease as the y = x line no longer begins to fall within the confidence intervals. 

```{r}
disperse(data.imp, dims=2, m=5)
```
### After running an Expectationâ€“maximization algorithm, we have evidence that even with different starting values, each of the imputations arrives at the same path of predictions.

```{r}
all.imp.data<- rbind(data.imp$imputations$imp1, data.imp$imputations$imp2, data.imp$imputations$imp3, data.imp$imputations$imp4, data.imp$imputations$imp5)

#histogram
hist(all.imp.data$income)
```

### The imputed data histogram shows an increase in the frequency of all the income groups, although specifically higher for those in the $0-$20,000 income bracket.  

```{r}
crosstab(all.imp.data$blues, all.imp.data$college, all.imp.data$income, prop.c = T, prop.r = T, plot = F, echo=F) 

aggregate(all.imp.data$income ~ (all.imp.data$college + all.imp.data$blues), data=all.imp.data, na.rm=T, mean)
```

```{r}
wtd.cor(all.imp.data$income, as.numeric(as.character(all.imp.data$college)))

wtd.cor(all.imp.data$income, as.numeric(as.character(all.imp.data$blues)))

wtd.cor(all.imp.data$income, as.numeric(as.character(all.imp.data$blues + all.imp.data$college)))
```

```{r}
model2 <- zelig(income~college + blues, model="normal", data=data.imp)
summary(model2)
```

### The results from the 2nd model show that both memberships in the blue group, and being a college graduate have a statistically significant effect on respondent income. With a coefficient of 7471, we see a $7,471 increase for those who are college graduates, per unit increase of income. With a coefficient of 10560, we see that membership in the blue group is associated with a $10,560 increase in income per every unit increase. We see a lower income increase for those in the blue group for imputed data, specifically a $207 decrease, and for college graduates, the income for the imputed data decreased by $732.
